## Python Simulation of Equations
This repository contains Python code for simulating mathematical equations using NumPy and visualizing the results with Matplotlib. You can use this code as a template for simulating and visualizing the behavior of equations in various scientific and engineering domains.

## Introduction
The code provided here is a starting point for simulating equations over a specified time interval. It includes example equations that you can replace with your own equations to perform simulations based on your specific needs.

## Features
Simulate equations over a defined time range.
Visualize the results of the simulations using Matplotlib.
Easily replace the example equations with your custom equations.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python_Simulation_Equations.git

## Install the required Python packages, if not already installed:
bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
Replace the example equations with your own equations in the equation_48 and equation_49 functions.

Modify the simulation parameters, initial conditions, and time integration method according to your specific requirements.

## Run the simulation code:

bash
python simulation.py
View the generated plots to analyze the results.

## Customization
You can customize this code for your specific needs by:

Modifying the equations in equation_48 and equation_49 to match your simulation objectives.
Adjusting the simulation parameters, such as the initial time, end time, and time step.
Implementing alternative integration methods or calculation procedures for your simulations.
